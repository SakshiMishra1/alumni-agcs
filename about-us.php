        <p>Since the beginning, the Society also started hosting the Annual Dinner. In the first year, Mr. Sankha Subha Roy had all the classrooms opened, and lightened, which was a great step in creating nostalgia, for the students visiting the school, on that day.

Over the years, the Society has co-sponsored various functions, treatments, which involved the school or former students. The Society, has now finally launched website officially on the Second  Coffee Meet of the Alumni, dated 17th December, 2022.

The members of the Alumni, are encouraged to be present at the Founder’s Day Service, held on the 27th day of January, every year. Students of class 12, are encouraged to join the Alumni, with the help of the School authorities, like the teachers, prefects etc.
